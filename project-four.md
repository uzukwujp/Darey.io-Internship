MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:

- Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
- Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user
